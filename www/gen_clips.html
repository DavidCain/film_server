<h2 id="about">About</h2>


<p>The above form will generate a .m3u file that can be used to play film
clips. The playlist contains named bookmarks that can be clicked to go to a
specific time in the film. If you open the .m3u file in VLC, then open the
bookmarks window, you will see a clickable list like in the image below.</p>

<p> <img src="images/bookmarks.png" title="Bookmarks as viewed in VLC" \></p>

<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions</h2>

<h3>For the impatient (quick instructions)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="#create_csv">Create a CSV</a> with desired start time, end time, and titles per clip.
    </li>
    <li>
        Upload your CSV.
    </li>
    <li>
        Give your film's title.
    </li>
    <li>
        Give <a href="#full_path">the absolute path to the movie</a> on
        whatever computer you want to play this file on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press "Generate playlist," and open the downloaded file in VLC or your
        media player of choice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Play the clips by clicking in the <a href=#bookmarks>Bookmarks</a>
        window.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bookmarks">The bookmarks window</h3>

</p>To open the bookmarks display in VLC:</p>
<p><b>Windows or GNU/Linux</b>: Playback -&gt; Custom Bookmarks </p>
<p><b>Mac</b>: Window-&gt; Bookmarks, or &#8984; B </p>


<h3 id="full_path">Getting the full path of a file</h3>

<p><b>Windows</b>: On a Windows 7 machine, you can copy the full path of
any file by right clicking, and selecting 'Copy Address as Text.'</p>
<p><b>Mac</b>: Right click your file, and select 'Get Info'. The full
path to the file can be found under the "Where:" field.</p>

<p> Note that if you've been playing the movies directly in your web
browser, this will not work for you. You need to download the film to
your hard drive and give the path on your computer. </p>

<h3 id="path_caveat">File not working on a different computer?</h3>

<p> The m3u playlist points to a specific video file. If you try to open
the playlist on a different computer, it will fail if there's no video at
the path specified. To get an m3u that will not fail, you will need to
provide the path of the video on that computer when generating the .m3u.

For example, you can make a playlist that will run on the classroom's
computer by specifying the movie file path as:
<pre>/Users/classroom/Desktop/East_of_Eden.m4v</pre>
(Substitute "East_of_Eden" with your video.) Then, simply download the
.m4v to the classroom's Desktop, and your playlist should work. </p>

<br />

<h2 id="create_csv">Creating a file with clip times</h2>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Clip times are read from a CSV file formatted like below: <a href="example_times.csv">(Valid example file)</a> </p>

<pre>0:04:17,00:04:52,"MUSIC:Overture fades"
0:05:02,00:06:38,"MUSIC:Integral to opening scene"
0:07:53,00:08:11,"GENDER:the timid bar maid"
0:10:25,00:10:35,"MUSIC:Something off about Kate"
0:29:00,00:30:30,"MUSIC:Cal visits Kate"</pre>

<p>The first column is the start time of the clip, the second column is
the end time, and the third column is the desired title. Times are in "hours:minutes:seconds" format. </p>

<p>You can edit this file in plaintext, if you wish. You can also create a
spreadsheet in Excel, and export it as CSV.</p>

<h3>Creating CSV file in Excel</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Edit a spreadsheet with the three columns: start time, end time, clip name (do not include a header).
        <br \>
        <img src="images/spreadsheet.png" title="Creating clip times in Excel"\>
    </li>
    <li>
        Save your spreadsheet as a CSV with "Save As."
        <br \>
        <img src="images/save.png" title="Saving clip times spreadsheet as CSV"\>
        <br \>
        <p>Excel will warn you about a few things that happen when
        converting to CSV. They're all fine, so skip through the
        warnings.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
